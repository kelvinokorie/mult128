            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>The red panda (Ailurus fulgens), also known as the lesser panda, 
                is a small mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China.
                 It has dense reddish-brown fur with a black belly and legs, white-lined ears,
                  a mostly white muzzle and a ringed tail. Its head-to-body length is 
                  51–63.5 cm (20.1–25.0 in) with a 28–48.5 cm (11.0–19.1 in) tail, and it weighs 
                  between 3.2 and 15 kg (7.1 and 33.1 lb). It is well adapted to climbing due
                   to its flexible joints and curved semi-retractile claws.</p>

            <h2>HABITAT</h2>
            <p>The red panda inhabits Nepal, the states of Sikkim, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh in India,
                 Bhutan, southern Tibet, northern Myanmar and China's Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>

            <h2>BEHAVIOUR</h2>
            <p>The red panda is difficult to observe in the wild,[57] and most studies on its behaviour have
                 taken place in captivity.[58] The red panda appears to be both nocturnal and crepuscular, 
                 sleeping in between periods of activity at night. It typically rests or sleeps in trees or other
                  elevated spaces, stretched out prone on a branch with legs dangling when it is hot, and curled 
                  up with its hindlimb over the face when it is cold. </p>

            <h2>DIET AND FEEDING</h2>
            <p>The red panda is largely herbivorous and feeds primarily on bamboo, mainly the genera Phyllostachys,
                 Sinarundinaria, Thamnocalamus and Chimonobambusa.[61] It also feeds on fruits, blossoms, acorns,
                  eggs, birds and small mammals. Bamboo leaves may be the most abundant food item year-round and 
                  the only food they can access during winter.[62] In Wolong National Nature Reserve, leaves of 
                  the bamboo species Bashania fangiana were found in nearly 94 per cent of analysed droppings, 
                  and its shoots were found in 59 per cent of the droppings found in June.[59]</p>

            <h2>COMMUNICATION</h2>
            <p>At least seven different vocalisations have been recorded from the red panda, comprising 
                growls, barks, squeals, hoots, bleats, grunts and twitters. Growling, barking, grunting 
                and squealing are produced during fights and aggressive chasing. Hooting is made in 
                response to being approached by another individual. Bleating is associated with 
                scent-marking and sniffing. Males may bleat during mating, while females twitter.[71] 
                During both play fighting and aggressive fighting, individuals curve their backs and 
                tails while slowly moving their heads up and down. They then turn their heads
                 while jaw-clapping, move their heads laterally and lift a forepaw to strike.
                  They stand on their hind legs, raise the forelimbs above the head and then 
                  pounce. Two red pandas may "stare" at each other from a distance.[29]</p>
