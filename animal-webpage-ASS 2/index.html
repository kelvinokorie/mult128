            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The red panda (Ailurus fulgens), also known as the lesser panda, 
                is a small mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China.
                 It has dense reddish-brown fur with a black belly and legs, white-lined ears,
                  a mostly white muzzle and a ringed tail. Its head-to-body length is 
                  51–63.5 cm (20.1–25.0 in) with a 28–48.5 cm (11.0–19.1 in) tail, and it weighs 
                  between 3.2 and 15 kg (7.1 and 33.1 lb). It is well adapted to climbing due
                   to its flexible joints and curved semi-retractile claws.</p>

            <h2>Behaviour</h2>
            <p>The red panda is difficult to observe in the wild,[57] and most studies on its behaviour have
                 taken place in captivity.[58] The red panda appears to be both nocturnal and crepuscular, 
                 sleeping in between periods of activity at night. It typically rests or sleeps in trees or other
                  elevated spaces, stretched out prone on a branch with legs dangling when it is hot, and curled 
                  up with its hindlimb over the face when it is cold. </p>
